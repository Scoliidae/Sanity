This is a template repository for St0rmWalker's python libraries

Sanity repository is aimed at platform independent python application development

Feel free to use this portion for your needs, any optimizations and security or bug fixes are always welcome additions

I am still learning as I develop this repository for my needs, and most of which is self-taught so please bear with me if I do not properly understand all inquiries. That being said please ask away. The more conversation the more I might learn from the interactions.

Furthermore, I'm not very acquainted with batch,vbs,shell,git scripting and I am trying my best but any help in those areas would be much appreciated. I can get a very basic program running with some parameters through them but at this portion of trhe repository was not aimed at learning those languages so much as Python

With Python being a language useful for data handling I thought this would be a good introduction into learning how to handle data bases to some capacity though I will have to dive more into whiich would be the most useful to implement. I want to keep the program lightweight for all users to use wherever possible so the smaller the better, that being said I do not want users data being shared so their databases will be of their own size, I think this may be an ideal way of tracking error reports sent to anyone working on this project without revealing private information but if used in tandem with games I want it to be capable of handling information players wish to store using it to help them.

That being said I want this repository long-term to be useable in many areas from business use to gaming with the aim towards gamers as that's always been a larger enjoyment of mine is getting to know the communities for the worlds we have all mutually divulged (never enough) time to.

This is the beginning of my gift to you my friends. This has been in the works for a long time well before the creatrion of this repository and to everyone who's helped me along the way. Thank you, it has helped me grow so much over the time of knowing you.
